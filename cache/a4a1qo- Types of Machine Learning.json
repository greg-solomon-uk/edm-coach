Supervised Learning**  \n- **Definition**: Learning from labeled data to make predictions.  \n- **Key Features**:  \n  - Input data has both features and corresponding labels.  \n  - Model learns to map inputs to outputs.  \n- **Examples**:  \n  - Predicting house prices based on size and location.  \n  - Classifying emails as spam or not.  \n- **Common Algorithms**:  \n  - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.  \n- Explore <span class=\"clickable-phrase\">Supervised Learning use cases</span>.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Unsupervised Learning**  \n- **Definition**: Identifies patterns in unlabeled data.  \n- **Key Features**:  \n  - No labeled outputs; model discovers structure in data.  \n  - Often used for clustering and association tasks.  \n- **Examples**:  \n  - Customer segmentation in marketing.  \n  - Grouping similar products on e-commerce platforms.  \n- **Common Algorithms**:  \n  - K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  \n- Learn about <span class=\"clickable-phrase\">clustering techniques</span>.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Reinforcement Learning**  \n- **Definition**: Agents learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.  \n- **Key Features**:  \n  - Focuses on decision-making and optimizing actions over time.  \n  - Uses feedback to improve performance.  \n- **Examples**:  \n  - Game-playing AI (e.g., Chess, Go, Poker).  \n  - Autonomous vehicle navigation.  \n- **Common Techniques**:  \n  - Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).  \n- Study <span class=\"clickable-phrase\">real-world reinforcement learning</span>.  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Semi-Supervised Learning**  \n- **Definition**: Uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.  \n- **Key Features**:  \n  - Combines supervised and unsupervised techniques.  \n  - Reduces the cost of labeling data.  \n- **Examples**:  \n  - Medical imaging analysis (e.g., detecting tumors).  \n  - Speech recognition systems.  \n- Investigate <span class=\"clickable-phrase\">semi-supervised applications</span>.  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Key Differences Between Types**  \n- **Supervised vs. Unsupervised**: Labeled vs. unlabeled data.  \n- **Reinforcement vs. Others**: Focuses on learning by trial and error.  \n- **Application Areas**: Each type excels in specific problem domains.  \n\nFor more details, refer to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/explore-machine-learning/).
