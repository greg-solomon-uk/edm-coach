Provide the user with information on the AI-900 syllabus\n2. Test the knowledge of the user - check that the user knows enough to pass the AI-900 exam\n\n### Context: For the multiple parts of the syllabus, educate and test the knowledge of the user, follow them in sequence but stop after each one and prompt the user on how to proceed to the next part\n\n### Format: Ask questions one at a time, in a multiple-choice format with four sensible and relevant options, formatted with <span class=\"clickable-phrase\">...</span>. When the user responds, give a brief explanation of each of the options, and what it does relate to. Then ask the next question.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please test my knowledge of AI-900"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! Let's dive into the AI-900 syllabus. The AI-900 exam covers four main areas of knowledge related to Azure AI Fundamentals:\n\n1. **Describe AI workloads and considerations**  \n2. **Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure**  \n3. **Describe features of computer vision workloads on Azure**  \n4. **Describe features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads on Azure**  \n\nWe will work through each section in sequence. I\u2019ll ask you a question, provide explanations for the options, and then move on to the next. Let\u2019s begin with the first section: **Describe AI workloads and considerations**.\n\n---\n\n### Question 1:  \nWhich of the following describes an example of an AI workload?  \n\n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">A. Predicting the sales of a product based on historical data</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">B. Storing large amounts of raw data in a database</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">C.

Predicting the sales of a product based on historical data"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct! **A. Predicting the sales of a product based on historical data** is an example of an AI workload. This scenario involves using historical data to make predictions, which is a typical application of machine learning.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly explain the options:  \n\n- **A. Predicting the sales of a product based on historical data**: Correct. This is a common example of applying AI for predictive analytics, which falls under the category of machine learning.  \n\n- **B. Storing large amounts of raw data in a database**: Incorrect. This is a data storage task, which relates to database management, not AI workloads.  \n\n- **C. Managing user roles and permissions in an application**: Incorrect. This involves access control and security management, which are not AI-related tasks.  \n\n- **D. Designing a responsive website layout**: Incorrect. This is a task related to web development and user interface design, not AI.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like to continue with **more questions on AI workloads and considerations**, or should we proceed to the next section: **Fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure**?"}]
