AI systems are rule-based and cannot learn from data.</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">B. AI systems can mimic human cognitive functions like learning and decision-making.</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">C. AI systems are only used for automation of physical tasks.</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">D. AI systems are exclusively used in robotics and hardware-based tasks.</span>  \n\nWhat's your answer?\n\n", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "B. AI systems can mimic human cognitive functions like learning and decision-making.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Correct! Let's break it down:  \n\n- **A. AI systems are rule-based and cannot learn from data:** Incorrect. While some systems are rule-based, AI systems often go beyond hard-coded rules to learn from data (e.g., machine learning).  \n- **B. AI systems can mimic human cognitive functions like learning and decision-making:** Correct. This is the essence of AI\u2014mimicking human intelligence for tasks such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making.  \n- **C. AI systems are only used for automation of physical tasks:** Incorrect. AI is used in a wide range of tasks, including cognitive tasks like language processing, vision, and decision-making.  \n- **D. AI systems are exclusively used in robotics and hardware-based tasks:** Incorrect. AI is applied across software domains, such as virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.  \n\n---\n\n#### Question 2:\nWhich of the following is an example of a real-world AI application?  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">A. Spam email filtering</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">B. Manual data entry</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">C. Physical equipment repair</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">D. A printed user manual</span>  \n\nWhat's your answer?", "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "A. Spam email filtering"}, {"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct! Here\u2019s why:\n\n- **A. Spam email filtering:** Correct. Spam email filtering uses AI, specifically machine learning, to analyze email content and classify messages as spam or not.  \n- **B. Manual data entry:** Incorrect. Manual data entry is not an AI application because it involves human effort without automation or intelligence.  \n- **C. Physical equipment repair:** Incorrect. While AI can assist in predictive maintenance, physical repair itself is typically a manual task.  \n- **D. A printed user manual:** Incorrect. A printed manual is static and lacks intelligence or adaptability, so it is not an AI application.  \n\n---\n\n#### Question 3:\nWhich of the following is NOT a type of machine learning?  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">A. Supervised learning</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">B. Reinforcement learning</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">C. Unsupervised learning</span>  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">D. Structured learning</span>  \n\nWhat's your answer?  "}]
