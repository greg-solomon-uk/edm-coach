AI systems are rule-based and cannot learn from data:** Incorrect. While some systems are rule-based, AI systems often go beyond hard-coded rules to learn from data (e.g., machine learning).  \n- **B. AI systems can mimic human cognitive functions like learning and decision-making:** Correct. This is the essence of AI\u2014mimicking human intelligence for tasks such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making.  \n- **C. AI systems are only used for automation of physical tasks:** Incorrect. AI is used in a wide range of tasks, including cognitive tasks like language processing, vision, and decision-making.  \n- **D. AI systems are exclusively used in robotics and hardware-based tasks:** Incorrect. AI is applied across software domains, such as virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.  \n\n---\n\n#### Question 2:\nWhich of the following is an example of a real-world AI application?  \n<span class=\"clickable-phrase\">A.
